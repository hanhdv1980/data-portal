<p>Open Peoria demonstrates transparency, civic engagement,
and innovation in Peoria. We collect and maintain data to
empower Peorians to create positive civic change.</p>

<p>For data to be used efficiently in our community, we need an Open Data Portal.
This is a publicly accessible database that makes it easy for activists, elected leaders,
businesses, the media, and civic data champions to answer our community's most pressing questions.

<p>Open Peoria's Open Data Portal was born at the <a href="http://www.openpeoria.com">2019 Peoria Civic Hackathon.<a/>
Over 30 people, including designers, developers, data scientists, and community activists gathered
at the Peoria Civic Center to lay out the foundation for this Open Data Portal. This Open Data Portal
is completely open source. You can view our code and begin contributing on <a href="https://github.com/openpeoria/">Open Peoria's Github page.</a></p>
